_A practical six-step roadmap to adopt AI-assisted development securely and at scale._

## 1. Strategy & Alignment

### Why this step
- Prevents tool-first adoption that creates chaos, shadow practices, and rework.
- Aligns AI initiatives to measurable business outcomes and delivery priorities.
- Builds early organisational buy-in, reducing resistance and fragmented efforts.

### Purpose
- Establish a shared vision, scope, and value narrative for AI in software delivery.
- Define decision rights, funding, and ownership to avoid ambiguity.
- Identify prioritised use cases and baseline metrics for measuring impact.

### Activities
- Define AI vision and objectives aligned to business and product priorities.
- Map value streams and identify bottlenecks where AI can help (e.g., reviews, testing, docs).
- Assess team and platform readiness: tools, skills, data, and culture.
- Select initial use cases with explicit success criteria and guardrails.
- Set baseline and target metrics (e.g., PR cycle time, lead time for changes, change failure rate, defect density, developer satisfaction).
- Create a communication plan and executive sponsor model; secure budget and resourcing.

## 2. Risk Management & Governance

### Why this step
- AI changes development surfaces (code, data, tooling), introducing new legal, ethics, and security risks.
- Consistent policy and oversight reduces compliance exposure and drift.

### Purpose
- Define decision-making forums, accountability, and acceptable use boundaries.
- Translate risk appetite into actionable policies, controls, and approvals.

### Activities
- Form a cross-functional AI governance committee with clear charter (tech, security, compliance, legal).
- Publish policies and standards: security, ethics, IP licensing, privacy, data residency.
- Define approval workflows for higher-risk actions (prod deployments, destructive changes, sensitive data access).
- Establish an exception and waiver process with time-bounded controls and compensating measures.
- Create a living risk register, taxonomy, and RACI for AI-related decisions.
- Specify auditability requirements: logging, retention, evidence for reviews.

## 3. Security & Compliance

### Why this step
- AI-generated and assisted code can introduce vulnerabilities and licence issues at scale.
- Data flowing through AI tools can create exposure without proper controls.

### Purpose
- Shift-left security and compliance controls into the AI-augmented SDLC.
- Enforce least privilege and ensure ongoing visibility and evidence.

### Activities
- Integrate SAST/DAST/SCA and dependency updates (Dependabot) into pipelines.
- Enable secret scanning, commit signing, and SBOM generation; enforce licence policies.
- Implement input/output logging for AI interactions with privacy filtering and PII minimisation.
- Apply permission boundaries: scoped tokens, branch protections, environment isolation.
- Configure continuous monitoring and alerting for model performance, misuse, and policy violations.
- Map controls to applicable regulatory frameworks and prepare audit evidence.

## 4. Pilot & Training

### Why this step
- Low-risk pilots surface real constraints, build champions, and de-risk rollout.
- Training ensures responsible use and consistent practices across teams.

### Purpose
- Validate value, refine guardrails, and establish repeatable enablement patterns.
- Equip teams with the skills to use AI safely and effectively.

### Activities
- Select pilot teams and non-critical products with clear scope and exit criteria.
- Define success metrics, baselines, and measurement plans; instrument telemetry.
- Deliver role-based training (developers, reviewers, security) and office hours.
- Capture feedback through structured channels; iterate tools, prompts, and policies.
- Produce case studies, playbooks, and templates for broader adoption.

## 5. Integration & Scaling

### Why this step
- Ad-hoc usage does not scale; standardisation prevents drift and duplicative effort.
- Automation reduces manual burden and enforces consistency.

### Purpose
- Embed AI into the SDLC with guardrails-as-code and platform integration.
- Provide paved roads, templates, and observability for sustainable scale.

### Activities
- Integrate AI assistants into CI/CD, reviews, testing, and docs with clear controls.
- Implement policy-as-code, pipeline gates, mandatory reviews, and audit logging.
- Publish reusable templates, snippets, and reference architectures; maintain a service catalogue.
- Define a staged rollout plan, change management, and onboarding pathways.
- Right-size platform-level permissions and rate limits for AI workloads.

## 6. Continuous Improvement & Ethical Use

### Why this step
- Models, tooling, and risks evolve quickly; controls and skills must keep pace.
- Ethical use sustains trust with customers, regulators, and developers.

### Purpose
- Continuously improve effectiveness, safety, and fairness of AI-assisted development.
- Maintain transparency and accountability across the lifecycle.

### Activities
- Schedule periodic policy and control reviews; run red-teaming and tabletop exercises.
- Evaluate bias, fairness, and transparency; document model and tool limitations.
- Track outcomes with dashboards (delivery, quality, security, adoption); run post-incident reviews.
- Define sunset and upgrade criteria for tools; manage deprecations.
- Foster a culture of augmentation, not replacement; recognise contributors and champions.
