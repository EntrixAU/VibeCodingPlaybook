## Core Principles

### Be Specific and Clear
- **Define the exact task**: Avoid ambiguous language
- **Specify constraints**: Include technical requirements, limitations, and boundaries
- **Set expectations**: Clearly state what you want as output

### Provide Relevant Context
- **Include necessary background**: Architecture, frameworks, coding standards
- **Specify the environment**: Language version, platform, dependencies
- **Define scope**: What should and shouldn't be included

### Use Structured Formatting
- **Break down complex requests**: Use bullet points or numbered lists
- **Separate concerns**: Distinguish between requirements, constraints, and examples
- **Use consistent terminology**: Maintain consistent language throughout

### Ensure Security and Compliance
- **Never include sensitive data**: No passwords, API keys, or confidential information
- **Use placeholder data**: Replace real data with synthetic examples
- **Follow organisational policies**: Adhere to security and compliance guidelines

## Prompt Structure

### Recommended Template

```markdown
## Task
[Clear, concise description of what you need]

## Context
- Language/Framework: [e.g., Python 3.9, React 18]
- Architecture: [e.g., microservices, MVC]
- Standards: [coding standards, style guides]

## Requirements
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Specific requirement 3]

## Constraints
- [Technical constraint 1]
- [Business constraint 2]
- [Security constraint 3]

## Expected Output
- [Format of desired output]
- [What should be included/excluded]

## Example (if applicable)
[Provide a relevant example]
```

---

## Security Guidelines

### Data Protection
- **Mask sensitive information**: Use `***`, `[REDACTED]`, or `[API_KEY]`
- **Use synthetic data**: Create realistic but fake examples
- **Avoid proprietary logic**: Don't expose trade secrets or confidential algorithms

### Access Control
- **Specify permissions**: What the AI can and cannot access
- **Define boundaries**: Which files, systems, or environments are off-limits
- **Set approval gates**: When human review is required

### Audit Trail
- **Document prompt intent**: Why this prompt was created
- **Version control**: Track changes to important prompts
- **Log usage**: Maintain records for compliance purposes

**Good:** "Refactor this function to improve readability, reduce complexity, and add error handling"

#### Missing Context
**Bad:** "Create a login function"
**Good:** "Create a login function for a Node.js/Express API using JWT tokens, with rate limiting and proper error handling"

#### Security Violations
**Bad:** Including real API keys, passwords, or sensitive data
**Good:** Using placeholders like `[API_KEY]`, `***`, or synthetic data

#### Overly Complex Requests
**Bad:** "Build a complete e-commerce platform with all features"
**Good:** "Create a product catalog service with CRUD operations and search functionality"

#### No Success Criteria
**Bad:** "Fix the performance issues"
**Good:** "Optimise the database query to reduce response time from 5 seconds to under 1 second"
