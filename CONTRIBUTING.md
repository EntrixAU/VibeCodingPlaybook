Thank you for your interest in contributing to the VibeCodingPlaybook! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively to this comprehensive resource for AI-assisted development.

## üéØ About This Project

VibeCodingPlaybook is a comprehensive guide that helps development teams adopt AI-assisted development practices safely, effectively, and at scale. The project focuses on providing practical guidance for governance, security, compliance, and best practices.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome

- **Content improvements**: Enhance existing sections with clearer explanations, better examples, or additional context
- **New best practices**: Add proven patterns and practices from real-world AI-assisted development experience
- **Case studies**: Share anonymized examples of successful (or failed) AI adoption stories
- **Security patterns**: Contribute security-focused guidance and threat models
- **Compliance insights**: Add regulatory and compliance considerations for different industries
- **Tool-agnostic guidance**: Ensure content remains vendor-neutral and broadly applicable
- **Documentation fixes**: Correct typos, broken links, formatting issues, or unclear sections

### What We're Looking For

- **Practical, actionable guidance** based on real-world experience
- **Vendor-neutral content** that doesn't promote specific AI tools or models
- **Security-first approaches** that prioritize safety and compliance
- **Enterprise-ready solutions** that scale across organisations
- **Evidence-based recommendations** supported by data or case studies


## üìù Content Guidelines

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **Actionable**: Focus on what readers can do, not just what they should know
- **Structured**: Use consistent formatting, headings, and organisation
- **Professional**: Maintain a professional tone suitable for enterprise audiences

### Content Structure

- **Start with context**: Explain why something matters before diving into details
- **Provide examples**: Include concrete examples, code snippets, or templates
- **Consider different audiences**: Address both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Link related concepts**: Cross-reference related sections and external resources

### Technical Standards

- **Vendor neutrality**: Avoid referencing specific AI models, tools, or vendors by name
- **Generic examples**: Use placeholder names like "[AI Model Name]" or "AI Development Environment"
- **Framework agnostic**: Ensure guidance applies across different regulatory frameworks
- **Future-proof**: Write content that won't become outdated quickly
